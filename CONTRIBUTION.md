## Background

Before you proceed I would like you to know that Translucent Flyouts Config was not meant for the public, but was a personal endeavour to make using Translucent Flyouts easier to use, for me. It was only when I approached the developer of Translucent Flyouts and it is because of his constant support, I am able to deliver a software that others can enjoy. I am really grateful for his help and efforts to make the FOSS community a better place.

## Contibution Guidelines

- The code should be well formatted and documented.
- I use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting purpose, any warnings or errors regarding linting, can be because you using something else.
- Commits should be well-written and descriptive, with a clear summary of the changes made and any relevant context.
- Test all changes before creating a pull request and make sure they don't conflict with the exisiting features.
- Pull requests should target the `main` branch and include a clear summary of the changes made.

- Run the `Scripts/build_and_pack_for_release.bat` to build an executable which disabled the console window for the application or run `Scripts/build_and_pack_for_testing.bat` to build an executable with the console window enabled. You can modify these scripts to change the release version.

- This way you will get a `TranslucentFlyoutsConfigV{release_version}.zip` file in the project directory.

## Translation Contribution

You can contribute to the language of your choice that you are confident in contributing to for this project. You may wanna look at [this](Translations/hi-in.json) translation file before proceeding to contribute.

For first time contributors use the following Steps:

- Fork the Repository.
- Create a file in the [Translations directory](Translations/) using the name convention `LanguageCode-CountryCode.json`, all in lowercase.
- Copy everything from [hi-in.json](Translations/hi-in.json) and paste it into you new file.
- Remove Hindi translations for each corresponding English ones and replace with translation for your respective language.

> [!Important]
> There's a translations where a line ends with `<code>` and another that starts with `</code>`, pay close attention and keep it that way in you translation as well, else it will break the code.
> Here are the lines:
>
> - `"Uses the corresponding value in the global tab as the <code>"`
> - `"</code> value."`

If you wanna go a few steps further and edit python, you might as well follow these:

- Open [Data/enum.py](Data/enums.py) and add an additional value to the class ` Languages`.
- Open [Data/paths.py](Data/paths.py) and under class `Translations` add the path to you translation path in the exact way as mentioned there for the previously mentioned language(s).
- Open [Data/translations.py](Data/translations.py) and under class `TranslationModel`, under method `_fetch()`, find a dictionary `translationPath` and add another pair in the format `LanguageEnum:LanguageJSONPathVariable`
- Open [main.py](main.py) and under method `__init__` you will find a line which says `self.language` with a list of language names in their own languages. Add one for the one you are adding.

> [!Note]
> If you just wanna do the first part, I'll accept PR for the same as well and do the 2nd part myself. But the 2nd part would be appreciated.
