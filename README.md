# Translucent Flyouts Config GUI

**Translucent Flyouts Config GUI** is a companion application for [Translucent Flyouts](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/TranslucentFlyouts) for Windows 10/11, which allows transparency and blur for windows32 style context menus.

Take a look at the [Config File](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/TranslucentFlyouts/blob/master/CONFIG.md) which provides description as well as methods to configure various aspects of the windows32 style context menus. Though some features are restricted to Windows 11 due to the absence of Mica on Windows 10.

This application contains everything necessary to be known and understood about configuring the appearance of context menus without the need to refer to the previously mentioned Config file.

> Note: This application just serves as a GUI to eliminate any kind of registry editing, required by the previously mentioned application to configure the appearnce of context menus. This is not a standalone application and is required to be used alongside [Translucent Flyouts](https://github.com/ALTaleX531/TranslucentFlyouts)
